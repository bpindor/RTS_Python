# The RMS (over time steps) per fine frequency channel for a set of obsids
# is generated by pipeline_qa_uvfits.py

# This can be run through the queue as an array job using the script
# sQA_pipeline_rms.sh (should make a version for different clusters?)

sbatch --array=[1-# of osids] [text file of obsids]

ie

sbatch --array=1-2 sQA_pipeline_rms.sh ../../EOR1_howto/list_2_obs.dat EOR1_2015_baseline

# This produces are file called [obsid]_rms.txt for each obsid in the list
# If no rms.txt file is produced then probably something is fishy with the uvfits for that obsid

# There is also a little plotting script which reads the rms.txt files for a list and plots them all on one plot

python plot_all_rms.py ../../EOR1_howto/list_2_obs.dat

# The y limits are hard-coded here, I should make these dynamic depending on the range of values
